# QUIDAX-QA-ASSESSMENT
This repository contains answers to the 'Task 2' of QUIDAX Quality Assurance Engineer Assessment.
Question below:
Write automated web-based tests for all positive test cases designed in Task 1
● A JavaScript framework eg Cypress is recommended. You can also use any other
framework you are comfortable working with.
● The framework should be designed using a page object model approach.
● Incorporate BDD into the framework if you are familiar with it.
Notes: Each test case should include validations for form actions. For example, In the single form demo page, when you enter a value into the text field, your test should actually check that the content matches what is displayed after clicking the ‘Show message’ button.
